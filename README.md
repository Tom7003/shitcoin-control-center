# shitcoin-control-center
Simple python script to manage what you mine. Requires XMR-STAK


# Running
This only works on Windows. Make sure you have python3 installed. To run, clone this repo to a directory with xmr-stak inside. 
Then just doubleclick on miner.py and follow the prompts

# Notes
There's literally no error checking. Files are saved as `config.coin_name` and read the same way.
